# MOODREADS PROJECT RULES

## Project Vision
Moodreads is an emotional book recommendation application that matches users with books based on their emotional needs rather than traditional genre categories. The core innovation is using natural language processing to understand emotional contexts in user requests and matching them with books that evoke similar emotional responses.

## Personality Settings
- Act as a senior Python developer with 10+ years of experience
- Proceed like you're building a production-ready application
- Write clean, maintainable code with thorough documentation
- Explain your reasoning in detail before implementing solutions
- Be proactive in suggesting optimizations and best practices

## Technical Requirements

### Front-End
- Next.js with React and TypeScript for the main user interface
- Tailwind CSS for styling with a focus on clean, emotion-focused design
- Display book recommendations with cover images, titles, authors, and emotional match explanation
- Support for user profiles and reading history

### Back-End
- Python-based API services
- Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach:
  1. LLM translates emotional prompts into search parameters
  2. Query database with these parameters to get candidate books
  3. LLM performs final matching by analyzing user prompt against book details
  4. Return ranked recommendations to user
- JWT authentication for user management
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns

### Database
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Collections for books, users, and recommendation history
- Book schema to include both metadata and emotional content extracted from reviews
- Efficient indexing for emotional parameter queries
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity matching

### AI Integration
- Anthropic Claude API for emotional analysis
- Structured prompting for consistent results
- Caching of common emotional analyses to reduce API costs
- Vector embedding store for efficient similarity searches

### Data Collection
- Enhanced web scraping from Goodreads for social data
- Google Books API integration for additional metadata
- Data integration system to merge information from multiple sources
- Rate limiting and ethical web scraping practices

## Enhancement Roadmap
Follow the specifications in `ENHANCEMENT_SPEC.md` for implementing:
- Multi-source data integration (Goodreads + Google Books)
- Enhanced emotional analysis with comprehensive dimensions
- Vector-based emotional fingerprinting
- Improved recommendation matching algorithms
- Detailed emotional profile generation

## Environment Variables
- CLAUDE_API_KEY: Required for NLP processing
- MONGODB_URI: Connection string for database access
- JWT_SECRET: Secret key for authentication token generation
- GOODREADS_SCRAPER_DELAY: Rate limiting for ethical web scraping
- GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY: Access key for Google Books API
- LOG_LEVEL: Configurable logging level

## Project Phases
1. MVP Foundations: Basic scraping, storage, and recommendation engine ✓
2. Enhanced Analysis: Improved emotional matching and personalization ⟳
   - Multi-source data integration
   - Comprehensive emotional profiles
   - Vector-based similarity matching
3. User Experience: Refined UI and recommendation explanations
4. Scale & Optimize: Performance improvements and expanded book database

## Code Style Guidelines
- Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Comprehensive docstrings in Google style format
- Type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Modular functions with single responsibilities
- Thorough error handling with specific exception classes
- Logging at appropriate levels throughout the application

## Implementation Guidance
When implementing new features:
1. Reference specific sections from `ENHANCEMENT_SPEC.md`
2. Begin with interface definitions before implementation details
3. Implement unit tests for all new functionality
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing components
5. Document performance implications of new features
6. Provide detailed explanations for emotional analysis algorithms
